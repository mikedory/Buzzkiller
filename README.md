##Buzzkiller##

__Wait, what?__

So I can't speak for you, but I don't like buzzwords.  I've worked in media companies and tech startups long enough to start to actually get a little itchy when someone says one.  Of course, this generally means a bunch fall out of my mouth too, and that makes me sadder.

A while back, I'd read about [Matt Might](matt.might.net)'s [weasel word Perl scripts](http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/), and I loved the idea.  So, after a conversation with a friend about buzzword-crazed emails, I decided I wanted to port the idea to Python.

This is so very, __very__ much a work in progress, but so far, it's fun!

You would run it thusly

    ./buzzkiller many various peak performance top-down silo

And it will tell you all about the things it finds.

Oh also, you'll need Argparse.
